# Single Channel LoraWAN Gateway
============================================================


This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation of a single channel LoRaWAN gateway. 
It has been tested on the ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1U, using a Semtech SX1276 transceiver (Reyax RYLR890).

The code is for testing and development purposes only, and is not meant for production usage.
